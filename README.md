# NHL-Age-TOI-Scoring
Project using detailed analysis of multivariate linear regression to analyze how player Age and Time on Ice is related to Goalscoring in the National Hockey League

This was my first real statistical modeling project. I recommend going reading the writeup pdf first. Then, go back and look at the code if interested.
In this project I covered the following methods:
  * Data Cleaning
  * Data Exploration
  * Data Visualization
  * Single-variate linear regression
  * Multi-variate linear regression
  * ANOVA
  * Regression Diagnostics
